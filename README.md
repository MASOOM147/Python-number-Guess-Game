## Introduction

The Number Guessing Game is a fun and interactive game where the player attempts to guess a random number generated by the computer. The game provides feedback on whether the player's guess is too high or too low, and the player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.

---

## Game Rules

1. The game generates a random number between 1 and 20, which the player must guess.

2. The player has up to 5 attempts to guess the correct number.

3. After each guess, the game provides feedback:
   - "Too low. Try again." if the guess is lower than the target number.
   - "Too high. Try again." if the guess is higher than the target number.
   - "Congratulations! You guessed the number [target_number] in [attempts] attempts." if the guess is correct.

4. If the player exhausts all 5 attempts without guessing the correct number, the game reveals the correct number and suggests trying again.

## Code Structure

The code consists of several functions and follows a structured flow:

- `welcome_player()`: Welcomes the player and asks for their name.
- `get_random_number()`: Generates a random number between 1 and 20.
- `get_player_guess()`: Gets and validates the player's guess.
- `play_game()`: Implements the main game logic, including generating the target number and handling guess attempts.
- `main()`: The main function to start the game by calling `welcome_player()` and `play_game()`.

## How to Play

1. When you run the code, you will be greeted with a welcome message and asked for your name.

2. The game will generate a random number between 1 and 20.

3. You will be prompted to guess the number. Enter your guess.

4. The game will provide feedback on whether your guess is too high or too low, or if you guessed the number correctly.

5. Continue guessing until you guess the correct number or exhaust all 5 attempts.

6. If you run out of attempts, the game will reveal the correct number and suggest trying again.
